## Intro
This bot sends messages by itself at a random period of time. it also responds to messages and doesn't use any kind of prefix to activate, it responds messages "naturally"

## Setup
To configure on the server, we will use: https://replit.com/
In the left tab in a new project, add two packages: discord.js and express

Now, click on the "Lock" icon on the left tab. In this tab, a new secret, set its name to `TOKEN` and its value to your discord bot's token in [discord developer dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
And now everything is ok

## Hosting

You can create an account on the website [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) and add a new monitor, then put the link of your Replit project, for example: `https://my-repl-name- -my-username.repl.co`, and activate the UptimeRobot service. it will be sending a ping, and keeping the bot active
